Combos add excitement, rewarding quick kills of three or more enemies with an ink refill to keep up the momentum. Upgrading your abilities is essential to survival—boost your ink bar's capacity and refill rate for more frequent attacks. These upgrades allow you to keep up with the growing enemy waves, adding depth to the action. As a final line of defense, your archer automatically fires arrows when enemies get close to the castle. Each enemy that reaches the castle costs you one of your three hearts, and losing them all means game over.

The objective of the game is to empty your hand cards by forming sets(melds) or minimize the total score when a fight is called or when the central stack is empty. Each player will be dealt 12 cards while the dealer gets 13, and the rest of the cards are left as a draw card. The game begins when the dealer dumps a card. The next person can either pick up the disposed card if that card makes a set or adds to a set they already have or get one from the central stack. Collect hand combinations and dump unnecessary cards. The picking and discarding of cards goes on until someone wins by Tongits, calls a fight, or until the central stack runs out of cards. If this happens, the players tally the points of the cards they have in hand, and the one with the lowest wins. To call a fight, the player needs to put down a meld on the table, and no player drops any card on any of their melds in that round. If the player can use all of their cards in combinations by connecting to opponents’ or the exposed card sets, or if the player gets rid of all their cards, then the player wins by Tongits. Have fun with your friends, enjoy exciting moments, and relieve your stress every day!",

Go towards the red rectangle to know their position on the map. HUD around your mech indicates its current status. The large arc represents the remaining hull, while the bar below is your shield level. Follow the red points to find your enemies. Damage will first get absorbed by a force field around the mech. When it's depleted, the hull gets damaged until the mech is destroyed. The mech can focus energy in front of it to reduce damage dealt to the shield. The shield itself recharges to 50% over time. Find pickups to go beyond that. For the first few seconds after the respawn, the mech is immune to damage, but its weapons are disabled. Every time you kill an enemy, you get a rank up and earn gears which you can trade for different mechs.",

In a small country where diamonds are mined, a military conflict has erupted, with various political forces vying for power. Mercenaries from around the world are joining the fray. You lead a squad of mercenaries, battling other players in dynamic PvP arenas. By winning these intense battles, you will earn a rating and climb the path to glory! Assemble a squad and a deck from the Hero and Ability cards available in the collection. At the beginning of the round, choose a hero from your squad. In battle, move your hero by clicking on the points behind the shelters to get significantly less damage. Your hero will attack the enemy automatically. Use the accumulated energy to use abilities to influence the battle's outcome. The round lasts until one of the heroes dies. To win the match, you need to win two rounds, and then you'll get a rating and a crate. You will only lose your rating if you're defeated. The higher your rating, the greater your rewards for winning matches. Open the crates, explore the cache, and advance along the Mercenary's Path to get new cards to upgrade your collection.",

Players have to show miracles of dexterity and demonstrate the accuracy of movements. Knowledge of physics and the ability to see the big picture, and calculate the balance will be useful. Don't be in a hurry because the main thing in this game is accuracy, so try on as much as you think is necessary. The game features three modes: single-player, two players, and against the AI. In single-player mode, you need to score as many points as possible. The lower the block is, the more points you will get by moving it to the top of the tower. There are several locations, types of blocks, and pleasant music to choose from in the game.",

		"description": "Master Qwan's Mahjong is a puzzle game in which you play a mahjong variation of Solitaire. You are matching pairs of tiles that have the same face, but both tiles need to have an open space to their right or left side. Some tiles will be stacked, so any tile on their side that is lower than their stack will not be considered as part of that rule. You should keep doing this until the board is cleared of all the tiles. If you run out of moves, you can select to shuffle the board, but it will cost you a bit of your score.",

As such, the goal of the game is to clear the board of all the tiles. This can be done by pairing identical tiles to remove them from play. There are a few restrictions though. First, you have to make sure that both tiles have a free side (left or right). Also, the tiles must not be under another tile. A Hint button is available if you're unable to find any more pairs, as well as a Shuffle button. You can only use them a limited number of times so be sure to use them wisely!",
